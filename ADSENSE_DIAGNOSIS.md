# AdSense Diagnosis: Why Ads Aren't Showing

## Current Situation
‚úÖ **Ad Containers**: Visible with dashed borders  
‚ùå **Actual Ads**: Not loading (no images/videos)  
‚úÖ **Technical Setup**: Correctly implemented  

## Most Likely Causes (Ranked by Probability)

### 1. **NEW ACCOUNT - REVIEW PERIOD** ‚≠ê **MOST LIKELY**
- **Issue**: Google AdSense accounts need approval before serving real ads
- **Timeline**: 1-14 days for new accounts
- **What You See**: Empty ad containers or "Ad not available" messages
- **Solution**: Wait for Google's approval email

**How to Check:**
1. Login to [Google AdSense Dashboard](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Look for account status at the top
3. Check for messages about site review

### 2. **INSUFFICIENT TRAFFIC/CONTENT** ‚≠ê **VERY LIKELY**
- **Issue**: Google requires substantial traffic and content before serving ads
- **Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 1,000+ page views per month
  - Original, substantial content
  - Regular visitors
- **Solution**: Build traffic and content over time

### 3. **AD INVENTORY AVAILABILITY**
- **Issue**: No relevant ads available for your audience/content
- **Location**: Nepal/specific geographic regions may have limited ad inventory
- **Time**: Certain times of day have fewer ads available
- **Solution**: Test at different times and grow your audience

### 4. **TESTING ENVIRONMENT**
- **Issue**: Limited ads during development/testing phase
- **Solution**: AdSense often shows fewer ads on new sites

## Technical Verification

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Publisher ID correctly set: `pub-2330812727201394`

### üîç Debugging Steps:

3. Look for the detailed debug information I added
4. Check for any error messages

**Step 2: Verify AdSense Account Status**
```
1. Go to https://www.google.com/adsense/
2. Check dashboard for:
   - Account approval status
   - Site approval status

   - Revenue reports (should show $0.00 if no ads served)
```

**Step 3: Test Different Scenarios**
- Test on different devices (mobile, desktop)
- Test with different browsers
- Test with ad blocker disabled
- Test at different times of day

## Expected Behavior by Account Status
