# Google AdSense Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Setup Status
✅ **AdSense Script**: Properly loaded in `<head>` section
✅ **Publisher ID**: `pub-2330812727201394` 
✅ **Ad Units**: 3 units configured with correct slot IDs
✅ **ads.txt**: Properly configured and uploaded
✅ **Debugging**: Added debug scripts and visual indicators

## Common Reasons Why Ads Don't Show

### 1. **Account Status Issues**
- **AdSense Account Not Approved**: New accounts can take 1-14 days for approval
- **Site Under Review**: Google needs to review your site before serving ads
- **Policy Violations**: Check Google AdSense dashboard for policy issues

### 2. **Technical Issues**

#### **Ad Blockers**
- Many users have ad blockers that prevent ads from loading
- Test on different browsers and devices
- Check browser console for blocked requests

#### **HTTPS Required**
- AdSense requires HTTPS websites
- Verify your site is accessible via `https://`

#### **Domain Issues**
- Ensure your domain is added to AdSense account
- Check that `ads.txt` file is accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/ads.txt`

### 3. **Content and Traffic Requirements**
- **Insufficient Content**: Your site needs substantial, original content
- **Low Traffic**: Some ad types require minimum traffic
- **Content Policy**: Ensure content follows AdSense policies

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open your website
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to `Console` tab
4. Look for our debug messages (they appear after 3 seconds)
5. Check for any errors related to AdSense

### Step 2: Verify ads.txt
Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/ads.txt`
Should show:
```
google.com, pub-2330812727201394, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

### Step 3: Test Ad Loading
1. Disable ad blocker temporarily
2. Clear browser cache
3. Test in incognito/private mode
4. Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Step 4: Check AdSense Dashboard
1. Login to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Check account status
3. Look for policy violations
4. Verify site is approved

## Visual Debug Indicators

I've added visual borders around ad containers that will show:
- **Dashed gray border**: Where ads should appear
- **Empty container**: Ads not loading
- **Content in container**: Ads are loading

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Deploy the updated site** (already done ✅)
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** for changes to take effect
3. **Check browser console** for debug information
4. **Test on different devices** and browsers

### If Ads Still Don't Show:
1. **Contact AdSense Support** with your Publisher ID
2. **Review site content** for policy compliance
3. **Check traffic requirements** for your region
4. **Consider ad placement optimization**
